# Twitter Sentiment Analysis and Excel Reporting

This project provides a Python script to perform **sentiment analysis** on Twitter data (or any text-based dataset with a 'Text' column) using 
**TextBlob** and then saves the results, including sentiment, sentiment percentage, and sentiment score, to an Excel file. 
The Excel output is further enhanced by **conditionally coloring cells** based on sentiment (positive in green, negative in yellow).

---

## Features

* **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and provides a sentiment score and percentage for text data.
* **Data Processing**: Reads data from a CSV file, cleans column names, and adds sentiment analysis results as new columns.
* **Excel Export**: Saves the processed data to an Excel file (`.xlsx`).
* **Conditional Formatting**: Automatically colors the 'Sentiment' column in the Excel output based on the determined sentiment, providing a quick visual overview.

---

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and CSV/Excel handling.
* **TextBlob**: For performing sentiment analysis.
* **openpyxl**: For advanced Excel file manipulation, specifically for applying conditional formatting.

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas textblob openpyxl
Installation and Setup
Project Structure:
/your-project-directory/
│── twitter.py            # The main Python script for sentiment analysis
│── twitter_dataset.csv   # Your input dataset (must contain a 'Text' column)
│── twitter_dataset_colored.xlsx # Output Excel file with sentiment analysis and formatting
│── README.md             # This documentation file
Steps:
Download the project files:
Place the twitter.py script in your desired project directory.

Prepare your dataset:
Ensure you have your Twitter dataset (or any text dataset) saved as a CSV file, for example, twitter_dataset.csv.
This file must contain a column named Text which holds the content you want to analyze.
Place this CSV file in the same directory as twitter.py.

Update file paths in twitter.py:
Open twitter.py and modify the input_file and output_file variables to match the actual paths on your system.

Python

input_file = "D:/twitter new sentiment/twitter_dataset.csv"  # Update this path
output_file = "D:/twitter new sentiment/twitter_dataset_colored.xlsx" # Update this path
Note: It's recommended to use relative paths (e.g., "./twitter_dataset.csv")
if the dataset is in the same directory as the script.

Run the script:
Execute the Python script from your terminal:

Bash

python twitter.py
Usage
Prepare your input CSV file (twitter_dataset.csv by default) with a
'Text' column containing the content you wish to analyze.

Run the twitter.py script.

The script will process the data, perform sentiment analysis, and save the results to the specified output_file (e.g., twitter_dataset_colored.xlsx).

Open the generated Excel file to view the sentiment, sentiment percentage,
sentiment score, and the color-coded 'Sentiment' column.

Output Excel Columns:
Sentiment: Categorical sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).

Sentiment_Percentage: The absolute strength of the sentiment (0-100%).

Sentiment_Score: The polarity score from TextBlob, ranging from -1.0 (most negative) to 1.0 (most positive).
